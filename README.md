# Loan-Calculator
You can use this application to calculate your loan. You would need to put your loan percentage and enter the amount you took the loan. Then enter how many months you have to pay the loan. Once you have all this information with the click of a button it will tell your monthly payment. This app is very useful to calculate your home, car and other loans. This app was developed for a class. I can modify the application if you have any suggestion. YOu can also feel free to modify the application as you wish.
